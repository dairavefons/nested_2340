    <h2>Letter From the Founders</h2>
    <p>Finding affordable furniture as college students was way harder than it should've been.</p>

    <p>As roommates trying to furnish our dorms, we spent hours scrolling through Facebook Marketplace — only to find listings that were already gone, sellers who lived too far, or deals that felt a little too sketchy. Without a car and with packed class schedules, the whole thing started to feel like a full-time job we never signed up for.</p>

    <p>It wasn't just frustrating — it made us realize there was no easy way for students to help each other out.</p>

    <p>That's why we created Nestd: a platform where Georgia Tech students can buy and sell furniture on campus — no trust issues, no endless scrolling, no long commutes, and no awkward meetups.</p>

    <p>We built Nestd to save students time, money, and stress. Because moving is already hard enough. Getting a couch shouldn't be.</p>
